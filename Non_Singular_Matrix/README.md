# Problem Statement

## Find a non singular matrix

- Assume that A is a non-singular matrix
- Resolve the equation 3A = A^2 + AB until it reduces to a simpler form for you to carry out simple array addition. Array A should be coming as A = 3I - B where I is the Identity matrix
- B = [[2,0,-1],[0,2,-1],[-1,0,1]]
